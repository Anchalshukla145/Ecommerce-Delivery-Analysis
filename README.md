# 🎯 **Objective 1: Delivery Performance & Time Analysis**

### ✔ Steps Performed:

* Converted date-time into usable attributes (Hour, Day, Month, Week)
* Created new features:

  * `Delay_Flag`
  * `Fast Delivery`
* Visualized:

  * Delivery Time distribution
  * Delivery Time vs Platform
  * Hour-wise delivery performance
  * Delay rate by category

# 🎯 **Objective 2: Platform Performance Comparison**

### ✔ Steps Performed:

* Compared platforms based on:

  * Average delivery time
  * Delay rate
  * Customer rating
  * Refund rate
  * Total orders
* Visualized platform-wise delivery speed

# 🎯 **Objective 3: Sentiment Analysis Based on Customer Feedback**

### ✔ Steps Performed:

* Cleaned feedback text
* Created keyword-based sentiment extractor
* Classified into:

  * **Satisfied**
  * **Not Satisfied**
  * **Neutral**
* Visualized sentiment distribution (bar + pie charts)
